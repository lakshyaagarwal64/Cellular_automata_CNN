# Cellular_automata_CNN
Modelling the dynamics of cellular automata in PyTorch using convolutional networks

The notebook is self-contained code for modelling the evolution of Cellular Automata via convolutional neural networks. We do this using PyTorch. In time, it will be extended to include arbitrary time-step evolutions.
